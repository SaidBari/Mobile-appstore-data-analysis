# Mobile-appstore-data-analysis using SQL only
This is a simple sql-only data analysis project with the goal of applying my learnings in sql and data analyis,
I used a mobile appstore dataset from kaggle and conducted exploratory data analysis along with statistical analysis querries
investigating market dynamics, user ratings, and pricing strategies.
This helped extract useful insights and inform decision-making, contributing to strategic app development and marketing.

in Querries.sql you can find all the querries with titles, results and my interpretations commented.
